# fashion_MNIST
Fashion MNIST dataset processing using logistic regression, neural network and convolutional neural networks. 
Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist 
TensorBoard has been used to plot learning curves for every model, on training and validation data 
(logistic regression with SGD, FCNN with dropout layers, CNN with maxpooling layers, 
deeper CNN, deeper CNN with batch-normalisation layers). Each model's accuracy has been calculated using test data.
